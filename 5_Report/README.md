## Wiper control system
Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen. The previous system used to activate the wiper manually and the process of pulling up the wiper is difficult to be handled. Thus, this system is proposed to solve these problems. The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing automatic wiping system, to improve the system by using sensor with actuator and to design a basic program that will fully operate with the system. The concept of this proposed wiper system is similar with other existing conventional wiper.Wiping system, to enhance the system by including a sensor and an actuator, and to create a simple software that would completely work with the system the framework. As the conclusion for the project, the results shows all the aim objectives are successfully achieved. The wiper system was well functionally according the water condition from the outside of a car. This project showed a contribution on the design of the automatic wiper system for the future research in this same field. It is recommended that the system to have a study on the wiper material that been used to make a wiper because the driver at hot and climate country are facing the problems regards to the wiper material.
## Introduction
A windscreen wiper or windshield wiper is a gadget used to eliminate downpour and flotsam and jetsam from a windscreen. Practically all engine vehicle, including trains, airplane and watercraft, are outfitted with such wipers, which are generally a fundamental prerequisite. A wiper for the most part comprises of an arm, turning toward one side and with a long elastic sharp edge connected to the next. The edge is swung to and fro over the glass, pushing water from its surface. The speed is ordinarily customizable, with a few constant paces and frequently at least one "intermittent"settings. Most automobilesuse two synchronized outspread sort arms. It takes a great deal of power to speed up the wiper sharp edges to and fro across the windshield so rapidly. To create this sort of power, a worm gear is utilized on the result of a little electric engine.
## SWOT- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats
## Strengths
Agreeable, Easy to utilize, Fast and exactness activity, Easy transportation
## Weakness
High Cost
## Opportunities
It is an Advanced System.
## Threat
Need to be Very Careful while using it
## 4W's and 1'H
## WHO
Any client who is going in the vehicle can utilize this framework.
## WHAT
Windshield wipers are a minor component of your vehicle, but they have a significant impact on your driving and overall safety. At the touch of a button, they quickly and cleanly remove rain, snow, dirt, pollen, frost, and other material. Windshield wiper arms are moved across the windshield by the windshield wiper motor.
## Where
A wiper drive and two wiper arms make up a windshield wiper system. The drive pushes the two wiper arms across the windshield at an angle that allows the driver and passenger to see clearly. A carefully contoured rubber wiping lip gives the best possible wipe.
## HOW
By fostering an inserted framework which is easy to understand and can be carried out easily.
