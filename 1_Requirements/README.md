## Introduction
   A windscreen wiper or windshield wiper is a gadget used to eliminate downpour and flotsam and jetsam from a windscreen. Practically all engine vehicle, including trains, airplane and watercraft, are outfitted with such wipers, which are generally a fundamental prerequisite. A wiper for the most part comprises of an arm, turning toward one side and with a long elastic sharp edge connected to the next. The edge is swung to and fro over the glass, pushing water from its surface. The speed is ordinarily customizable, with a few constant paces and frequently at least one "intermittent"settings. Most automobilesuse two synchronized outspread sort arms. It takes a great deal of power to speed up the wiper sharp edges to and fro across the windshield so rapidly. To create this sort of power, a worm gear is utilized on the result of a little electric engine.
   
## SWOT- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats:
## Strengths
Agreeable, Easy to utilize, Fast and exactness activity, Easy transportation
## Weakness
High cost
## Opportunities
It is an Advanced System.
## Threat
 Need to be Very Careful while using it
## SOFTWARE USED 
STM32CubeIDE
## COMPONENTS 
 STM32F4O7VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD
## STM32F407VG 
 The STM32F407 Kit takes advantage of the high-performance STM32F407 microcontrollers' capabilities to make it simple for users to create audio-based applications.It comes with an ST-LINK embedded debug tool, an ST-MEMS digital accelerometer, a digital microphone, an audio DAC with integrated class D speaker driver, LEDs, pushbuttons, and a USB OTG micro-AB connector.Ethernet connectivity, an LCD display, and other features have been added to the STM32F4 DISCOVERY kit. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx families are built around the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core, which runs at up to 168 MHz.

## WHO 
Any client who is going in the vehicle can utilize this framework.
## WHAT
Windshield wipers are a minor component of your vehicle, but they have a significant impact on your driving and overall safety. At the touch of a button, they quickly and cleanly remove rain, snow, dirt, pollen, frost, and other material. Windshield wiper arms are moved across the windshield by the windshield wiper motor.
## WHEN 
Used during the heavy rain
## Where 
A wiper drive and two wiper arms make up a windshield wiper system. The drive pushes the two wiper arms across the windshield at an angle that allows the driver and passenger to see clearly. A carefully contoured rubber wiping lip gives the best possible wipe.
## HOW 
By fostering an inserted framework which is easy to understand and can be carried out easily.
